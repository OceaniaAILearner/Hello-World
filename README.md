Hey!!

It's your girl OceaniaAILearner! Just sayin' I'm not from the continent Oceania (for those of you judging by my username).
I'm just a 11 year old girl with a dream - to become a AI researcher! 
I've always been obsessed with tech and coding, especially in the field of AI and robotics.
 I've gotta go,write more next time!
